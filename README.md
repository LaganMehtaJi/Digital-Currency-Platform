# Digital Currency Platform - Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements and specifications for building a **Digital Currency Platform**. The platform will allow users to buy, sell, and transfer a custom digital currency (similar to cryptocurrency) and will integrate with real payment gateways like **Razorpay**. The platform will also include **face scan authentication** for withdrawals, ensuring security.

### 1.2 Scope
The Digital Currency Platform will support the following key features:

- **Coin Purchase:** Users can purchase the digital currency using real money (via Razorpay).
- **Wallet System:** Users will have a digital wallet to store their coins.
- **Transaction System:** Users can send and receive coins from other users.
- **Blockchain Simulation:** All transactions will be recorded in a blockchain-like structure for transparency.
- **Face Scan Authentication:** Used for secure login and withdrawal authorization.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins will manage user transactions and monitor activities.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **API:** Application Programming Interface
- **JWT:** JSON Web Token (used for authentication)
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing data
- **Razorpay:** Payment gateway for transactions
- **Blockchain:** A decentralized ledger for recording transactions
- **Face Scan:** Biometric authentication for secure login and withdrawals

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Digital Currency Platform will be a web-based application built using **Node.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** for data storage, and **React.js** for the frontend. The mobile version will be developed using **React Native**.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
- **End User:** Regular users who will create an account, buy coins, transfer coins, and use face scan authentication.
- **Admin:** Admins who will monitor transactions, approve withdrawals, and manage users.
- **System:** The platform, including its APIs, frontend, and backend components, integrated with external services like Razorpay.

### 2.3 Operating Environment
- **Backend:** Node.js running on a cloud-based server (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
- **Frontend:** React.js for the web, React Native for the mobile app
- **Database:** MongoDB hosted on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas
- **Blockchain Simulation:** Local Node.js server for simulating a blockchain

### 2.4 Constraints
- The platform must handle a reasonable number of transactions per second, keeping in mind the simulation nature of the blockchain.
- Face scan authentication will be limited to devices with front-facing cameras.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 User Authentication
**Description:**  
Users must register and log in to the platform. Authentication will be performed using **JWT** for session management, and passwords will be securely hashed using **bcrypt**.

- Users should be able to create an account using their email and password.
- **JWT** will be used for session management.
- Passwords will be hashed and stored securely.

### 3.2 Coin Purchase and Payment
**Description:**  
Users can purchase the platform's digital currency (**LaganCoin**) via **Razorpay**.

- Razorpay will be integrated for coin purchase.
- Users will be able to add money via UPI, credit/debit cards, or net banking.
- Upon payment, the user's balance will be updated with the purchased **LaganCoin**.

### 3.3 Wallet System
**Description:**  
Users will have a wallet to store their purchased coins.

- The wallet balance will be visible on the user's dashboard.
- Users can send and receive coins within the platform.
- Each transaction will be recorded on the blockchain.

### 3.4 Blockchain Simulation
**Description:**  
A simulated blockchain will record transactions, ensuring transparency.

- Each transaction will create a new block.
- Transactions will be stored in a blockchain-like structure.
- A block will contain transaction details, hash, and previous block hash.

### 3.5 Face Scan Authentication
**Description:**  
Users will authenticate via face scan to log in or make withdrawals.

- Face scan will be required for withdrawals.
- Users will be required to register their face data during sign-up.
- Authentication can be done using front-facing cameras on web and mobile platforms.

### 3.6 Admin Dashboard
**Description:**  
Admins will have a dashboard to monitor platform activity.

- Admins will be able to view user details, transaction history, and manage withdrawal requests.
- Admins can approve or reject withdrawal requests.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Hardware Interfaces
- **Face Scan:** Requires front-facing cameras on the user's device.
- **Payment Gateway:** Integration with **Razorpay** for payments.

### 4.2 Software Interfaces
- **Razorpay API:** For payment processing.
- **MongoDB:** For data storage and transaction management.
- **JWT:** For authentication and session management.

### 4.3 Communication Interfaces
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** For communication between the client (web and mobile) and the backend.
- **WebSocket:** For real-time updates, like balance changes and transaction status.

## 5. System Design and Architecture

### 5.1 Architecture Diagram
**Note:**  
You can create this diagram later on GitHub using tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Microsoft Visio**.

- Frontend (**React.js/React Native**) communicates with the Backend (**Node.js, Express**) via **REST APIs**.
- The Backend interacts with **MongoDB** for data storage and **Razorpay API** for payments.
- Blockchain transactions are stored in **MongoDB** and are structured to simulate a real blockchain.

## 6. Appendices

### 6.1 Glossary
- **Coin:** The digital currency created on the platform (**LaganCoin**).
- **Blockchain:** A decentralized ledger that records all transactions made on the platform.
- **Face Scan:** A biometric authentication method for user login and withdrawal verification.

### **Upload to GitHub**

1. **Create a repository** for the project, such as **`DigitalCurrencyPlatform`**.
2. **Add this file** as `README.md` inside your project directory.
3. **Push** your changes to the GitHub repository.

---

This should give your **README.md** file a clean, professional, and **attractive layout**. You can now upload it directly to **GitHub** to showcase the **Software Requirement Specification** for your **Digital Currency Platform** project.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional elements!
